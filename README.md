1. Game Concept:
The player controls a character in a limited space where they need to shoot enemies using a color-matching gun. The challenge is to use the same color gun to hit corresponding color enemies, requiring both strategy and precision.

2. Gameplay Mechanics:

Character Control: The player navigates a character within a confined area, avoiding enemy fire or other obstacles.
Shooting Mechanism: The player can shoot using a gun that has a specific color, and to eliminate an enemy, the gun’s color must match the enemy's color. If the enemy touches the character, blood will be lost gradually.
Limited Space: The game area is constrained, adding an element of difficulty as the player has to think quickly and maneuver within the space to avoid getting hit or missing shots.

3. Enemy Behavior: Enemies move in unpredictable patterns or towards the player, adding an element of challenge.

4. Difficulty Progression: As the player progresses, the difficulty increases, with more enemies appearing at a faster pace or more complex color-matching challenges.

Controls:

The game could be played using keyboard, mouse with the player controlling movement of the character.
Simple, intuitive controls allow the player to focus on the action and strategy of shooting the enemies correctly.

5. Game UI: The Heads-Up Display (HUD) shows the current score, remaining enemies, and the player’s health.
